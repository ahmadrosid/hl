This register will parse one line, the lexer will stop when is reach the new line char `\n`.
```java
// This is comment.
This is not valid comment.
```

This register will parse the multi line string, the lexer will stop when is reach the end comment mark `*/`.
```java
/*

 */
This is not valid comment.
```
