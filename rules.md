### Comment
Programming language has several implementation of comment, to generate lexer for detecting the comment we have several register for that.

#### 1. slash_comment
This register will parse the line as comment like this, the lexer will stop when is reach the new line char `\n`.
```java
// This is comment.
This is not valid comment.
```

#### 2. slash_star_comment
This register will parse the multi line string, the lexer will stop when is reach the new line char `*/`.
```java
